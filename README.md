# Operating Systems Project - Process and Thread Management

## Project Overview
This project focuses on process and thread management in operating systems. It is implemented in C and runs on Unix-based systems. 
The project demonstrates the efficiency and differences between multithreading and multiprocessing approaches.

## Files in the Repository
- main.c - Implements naive functionality.
- threading.c - Implements multithreading functionality.
- processing.c - Implements multiprocessing functionality.
- OSreport.pdf - Detailed project report.

## Key Performance Metrics
-- Multithreading: Execution was 2.3× faster than the naive approach.  
- Multiprocessing: Execution was 2× faster than the naive approach.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the advantages and trade-offs between multithreading and multiprocessing in operating systems. Further optimizations can enhance performance and stability.
